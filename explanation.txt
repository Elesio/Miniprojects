A list of all miniprojects saved in this repository
(Probably important because surely i will forget about all of these things later on):
Python:
-likes.py displays different messages based on how many people and who liked an imaginary post, comparable to how it is handled on certain social media sites
-ludic.py generates ludic numbers(essentially prime numbers)
-recnum.py solves a number for its recursive sum
